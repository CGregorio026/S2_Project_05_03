/* Article Styles */

/* 
I float the article to the left and set the size to 384 pixels. Usually the page is set in relative units, but because this is being used for an infographic to be displayed on only one screen, which has a known width of 1152 pixels.
*/
article {
    float: left;
    width: 384px;
}


/* First Line and Drop Cap Styles */
/* 
This means that the first paragraph in the article's first line will have a relative font size and be displayed in capital letters.
*/
article p:first-of-type::first-line {
    font-size: 1.25em;
    font-variant: small-caps;
}

/* 
This affects the first paragraph in the article's first letter alone.
*/
article p:first-of-type::first-letter {
    font-size: 4em;
    font-family: serif;
    float: left;
    line-height: 0.8em;
    margin-right: 5px;
    margin-bottom: 5px;
}

/* Aside Styles */
/* 
This floats the aside element to the left and sets it to 768 pixels, which is 1152-384 pixels. This makes up the rest of the page layout, making the entire content of the body 100%.
*/
aside {
    float: left;
    width: 768px;
}


/* Map Styles */
/* 
I referred to the id instead of the element because one element can ever have an id.
*/
#battleMap {
    width: 688px;
    margin: 20px auto;
    position: relative;
}

#mapImage {
    display: block;
    width: 100%
}

/* Interactive Map Styles */


a.battleMarkers {
    position: absolute;
}

/* 
I just referred to this as the id instead of putting the id because only one element at one time can ever have an id. This is in absolute positioning, which places the markers from the top left corner.
*/
#marker1 {
    top: 220px;
    left: 340px;
}

#marker2 {
    top: 194px;
    left: 358px;
}

#marker3 {
    top: 202px;
    left: 400px;
}

#marker4 {
    top: 217px;
    left: 452px;
}

#marker5 {
    top: 229px;
    left: 498px;
}

#marker6 {
    top: 246px;
    left: 544px;
}

/* Map Information Styles */
/* 
This sets the default map info to hidden, so it is not displayed on the page regularly. The only way it will be displayed is by being called upon by the webpage (As seen in the next step)
*/
div.mapInfo {
    display: none;
}

/* 
When the battle markers are hovered over, it will display what is in the map info class as a block element.
*/
a.battleMarkers:hover+div.mapInfo {
    display: block;
}
